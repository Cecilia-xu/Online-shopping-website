we use MEAN stack framework(MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) to build our e-commerce website, which can meet the requirements of
both users and administrators.

Our website provides the following functions: login, log out, viewing and modifying customer profile, searching products, browsing products, 
adding products to the shopping cart, placing orders, viewing past orders, managing the products inside the store, adding products, updating
products, deleting products, managing usersâ€™ information and managing transactions.

with different interfaces to achieve different goals, mobileresponsive, MVC Structure, RESTful Web service, location aware and aesthetic 
pages.
